<img src="https://yarnspinner.dev/img/YarnSpinnerLogo.png" alt="Yarn Spinner logo" width="100px;" align="right">

[Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev) is the friendly tool for writing dialogue in games. It's easy for writers to use, and has powerful features for programmers.

Yarn Spinner is a dialogue system that lets you write interactive conversations in a simple, screenplay-like format, which can be loaded into your game and run. 

When a conversation is running, Yarn Spinner sends your game **lines** of dialogue to show, **options** to let the player choose from, and **commands** to make things happen in your scene. 

Yarn Spinner has been used in a number of critically acclaimed games, including [Night in the Woods](http://nightinthewoods.com), [A Short Hike](https://ashorthike.com), [Lost in Random](https://www.ea.com/en-au/games/lost-in-random), and many more.

It's free to download and use for free and commercial games, and is open source under the terms of the MIT License.

This repo contains the Unity integration; you can find the core [Yarn Spinner compiler](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner) in its own repository.
